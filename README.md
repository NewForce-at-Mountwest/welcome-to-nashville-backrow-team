# Welcome to Nashville: Build an itinerary for a day trip to Music City

There are many things to see and do in Nashville.  This page will allow you to search four different categories:

* Restaurants--search by food type, such as 'Chinese' or 'American'
* Meetups--search by topic, such as 'running' or 'knitting'
* Concerts--search by music genre, such as 'rock' or 'country'
* Parks--search by park feature, such as 'dog park' or 'playground'

## Search
When you enter a term in the search bar, click the 'search' button next to the search field.

The results of each individual search will populate the results box down below.

If you click the "save" button next to any one of those results, it will add it to your itinerary at the bottom of the page.

If you decide you would rather save a different search result, you can click a different save button and it will replace what is in your itinerary for that category.

You can continue to search through the four different categories (Restaurants, Meetups, Concerts, and Parks) and add things to your itinerary as desired.

## Finalize and Save Your Itinerary
Once your itinerary is the way you like it, you can click "save current itinerary" to finalize and save it.

If you would like to make multiple itineraries, you can click the "add to itinerary list" button.  Note, clicking this button multiple times will continue to add the current itinerary to the list over and over.

## View Saved Itineraries
To see your saved itineraries, click on the "saved itineraries" tab at the top of the page.  This will take you to a new page that has a list of your saved itineraries.

If you would like to delete one of these itineraries, just click the 'delete' button on the itinerary you would like to delete and it will disappear from the page.

You can always switch back to the "Build Itinerary" page to see the search fields and build another itinerary.

We hope you find this tool helpful and you enjoy your time in Music City!
